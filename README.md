# This is a personal project of mine

## this is how I unwind at the end of the day

I like to figure out how to code simple command line games. I don't use any tutorials or books. I just think about it, and write my code. sometimes I reopen the same code and try to figure out how to refactor it. it's always in progress...

I love Python, but it's not the language I work in. The language I work in is strongly typed and the legacy code base I've inherited is chaotic. So for me, writing these simple games in python is like meditating at the end of the day. somehow I've reached a point in my life where reading python code brings me some pretty solid inner peace.

if for some reason you're here at a professional capacity to gain some insight into how I code... this repo would be an honest assessment of my ability to solve problems with code, for better or worse.

cheers!
